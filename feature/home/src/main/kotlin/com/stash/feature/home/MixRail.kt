/**
 * Freshest first: the mix that most recently gained a track leads the rail.

 * Home's rails used to inherit the DAO's `ORDER BY p.name ASC`, so their head
 * was a fixed alphabetical prefix of the library — a sync could pull in hundreds
 * of songs and Home looked untouched, because the mixes that changed sorted into
 * the middle of an uncapped rail. Ordering by last-gained-a-track makes the rail
 * head exactly what the last sync found.
 *
 * [recency] maps playlist id -> epoch millis of its newest live membership
 * (PlaylistDao.observeLatestAdditionPerPlaylist). A mix with no live memberships
 * is absent from it and sorts last rather than jumping the queue. Name is the
 * tie-break: a sync writes many rows in the same millisecond, so ties are the
 * common case, and without it the rail would reshuffle on every emission.
