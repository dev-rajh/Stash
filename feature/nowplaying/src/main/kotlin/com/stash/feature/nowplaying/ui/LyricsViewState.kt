/**
 * v0.9.36 Task 12 — Now Playing lyrics sheet view state.
 *
 * Sealed hierarchy the [LyricsBottomSheet] renders one-of:
 *  - [Loading]      Track has never been tried (`lyricsFetchedAt == null`).
 *                   The sheet enqueues a priority worker on open and waits.
 *  - [Synced]       LRC parsed into a non-empty [LrcLine] list. Used by
 *                   [LyricsSyncedRenderer] for the auto-scroll + tap-to-seek
 *                   experience. Carries [plainFallback] so the renderer can
 *                   degrade gracefully without re-fetching if it ever needs
 *                   to render plain text.
 *  - [Plain]        Un-timed lyrics only (or synced text that didn't parse
 *                   and there's a plain-text body to fall back to).
 *  - [Instrumental] Source confirmed the track has no lyrics. Distinct
 *                   from [None] because it's a positive answer, not a miss.
 *  - [None]         Either the fetch ran and every source definitively
 *                   answered "no lyrics" (`lyricsFetchedAt == 0L`), or the
 *                   row has no usable text. Sheet shows a Retry CTA wired
 *                   to [LyricsBottomSheet]'s `onRetry`.
 *  - [Error]        The fetch FAILED (network/HTTP/parse — sources threw)
 *                   rather than missed. Not produced by these mappers: the
 *                   ViewModel emits it directly — for library tracks via the
 *                   failed-fetch overlay (stamp stays NULL so the track
 *                   remains retryable), for streaming tracks when
 *                   `resolveTransient` throws. Distinct from [None] so a
 *                   flaky connection reads "Couldn't load" + Retry, not the
 *                   false-permanent "No lyrics found".
