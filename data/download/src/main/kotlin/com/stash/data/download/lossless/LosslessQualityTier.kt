/**
 * User-selectable lossless quality tier. Maps directly to Qobuz's integer
 * `format_id` codes used by both squid.wtf and kennyy.com.br proxies.
 *
 * The catalog API may legitimately return a lower tier than requested when
 * the upstream master doesn't exist at the requested resolution (e.g. asking
 * for `MAX` (24/192) on a track Qobuz only has at CD quality returns 16/44.1).
 * That's why the v0.9.11 design persists the *delivered* bit-depth/sample-rate
 * read from the file (via `AudioDurationExtractor`), not the requested tier.
 *
 * `MP3_320 (5)` is intentionally excluded — this enum governs the lossless
 * picker only; the lossy/yt-dlp path is governed by `core.model.QualityTier`.

     * lossless tiers, which is a wart; the alternative was a parallel type threaded
     * through five resolvers for one extra case.
