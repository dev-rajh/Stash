/**
 * Eager-bound singleton that observes three signals and enqueues a
 * [LosslessRetryWorker] on each transition that could plausibly turn
 * a previously-null lossless resolution into a non-null one:
 *
 *  1. The user's captcha cookie value changes (fresh squid attempt
 *     possible).
 *  2. [QobuzSource.lastKnownBadCookie] clears or rotates (squid self-
 *     recovered, or user pasted a different value than the rejected one).
 *  3. [AggregatorRateLimiter.circuitResetEvents] emits any source id
 *     (kennyy outage cleared, or user manually reset the breaker).
 *
 * No periodic polling — these signals cover every state transition
 * that matters. Worker is enqueued under a unique work name with
 * [ExistingWorkPolicy.KEEP] so multiple triggers within a short window
 * collapse to a single sweep.
 *
 * Lives in `:data:download` rather than `:core:data` because
 * [LosslessRetryWorker] is module-local here and `:data:download` →
 * `:core:data` (not the other way). `StashApplication` calls [start]
 * once during `onCreate()`; the explicit-`start()` shape (rather than
 * an eager `init { }`) keeps unit tests free to install the test
 * dispatcher / scope before collectors are wired up.
