/**
 * Measures integrated loudness (LUFS) and true peak (dBFS) of an audio file
 * using ffmpeg's `ebur128` filter.
 *
 * ## Why this class exists
 *
 * EBU R128 loudness is the only standardised way to compare playback level
 * across tracks of mixed mastering era / genre. We measure once per track at
 * download/import time, persist the LUFS value, and apply per-track makeup
 * gain at playback (see [LoudnessGainProcessor]). This wrapper isolates the
 * ffmpeg invocation behind a coroutine-suspending API so the backfill worker
 * and the import pipeline can treat measurement as just another I/O call.
 *
 * ## ffmpeg invocation
 *
 * Args mirror the canonical "measure-only" recipe from the EBU R128 docs:
 *
 *   `-nostats -hide_banner -i <file> -af ebur128=peak=true -f null -`
 *
 * - `peak=true` enables the true-peak limiter on the filter side so the
 *   `Peak:` line appears in the Summary block (it's omitted by default).
 * - `-f null -` discards the decoded audio after analysis — we only care
 *   about the stderr Summary block, not the decoded samples.
 * - `-nostats -hide_banner` keeps stderr tight so the parser regexes don't
 *   have to wade through frame=…  progress lines and the long banner.
 *
 * ## Output parsing
 *
 * `ebur128` emits a single Summary block on stderr at end-of-stream. The
 * parser regexes pull `I:` (integrated loudness in LUFS) and `Peak:` (true
 * peak in dBFS). `-inf LUFS` is treated as a failure — it usually means the
 * track was shorter than the integration window (~3s) or all-silence, and
 * a Float infinity would otherwise propagate into [LoudnessGainProcessor]
 * with disastrous results.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * The internal [mutex] serialises calls so we never have two ffmpeg
 * processes contending for CPU and decoder buffers simultaneously. The
 * backfill worker measures one track at a time anyway, but the mutex is
 * cheap insurance against parallel import paths slipping past in the
 * future.
